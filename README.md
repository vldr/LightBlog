# LightBlogExpress
Robust, Fast, MySQL bbcode http blog system written in C++ (tested on MSVC2015). The project is based off of (https://github.com/vldr/LightBlog) and (https://github.com/eidheim/Simple-Web-Server).

This project is the C++ alternative to the PHP version which runs a lot more differently than this one. It's incredibly easy to create themes for this blog and it's pretty robust.

# Dependencies
* Boost C++ libraries
* OpenSSL libraries
* MySQL Connector (https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/connector/cpp/)

# Binaries
Usage: `LightBlog.exe DB_HOST DB_USER DB_PASS DB_NAME`
